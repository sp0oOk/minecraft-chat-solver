# minecraft-chat-solver
A minecraft chat-game solver!

Has the capability to do the regular "type a word as fast as possible", and unscramble words in chat. This is regex specific to the sevrer this was requested to be made for, change it if you wish to use this code or it obviously will not work. ^_^

Made for whatever server SteroidMC is (I have no idea LMAO)

Note: I never added logic to reconnect if the bot was FULLY kicked from the server. However, there is a custom event for when the server (SteroidMC) kicks you randomly to reconnect 1-2s later, seems to solve the issue after only kicking you once. (seems to just be a genuine server issue, no idea)

# Setup
* Simply run `start.bat`, it will install all the required dependencies.
* Fill in the required .env fields
* Run `start.bat` again!
